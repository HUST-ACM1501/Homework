  1. Implement the algorithm computing the optimal cost of multiplying matrices as discussed during the class.
  2. An alignment of two strings s1 and s2 is defined as a matching between the letters in s1 and those in s2 such that for each pair of matchings (s1[i],s2[j]) and (s1[k],s2[l]), where s[m] denotes the letter in string s with position m,  i < k if and only if j < l. For each unmatched letter m, there will be a penalty of δ (m); for each pair of matched letters a and b, there is a penalty of α(a,b). Design an algorithm which finds an alignment with the minimum sum of penalties given the strings to align and the values of all the penalties δ and α. (1)Solve the str problem with dynamic programming algorithm.  (2)Solve the str problem with ST algorithm. (3) Compare the efficicency.
