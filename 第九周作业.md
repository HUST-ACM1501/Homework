  1. After last class,you have already known some minimum spanning tree algorithms: Prim, Kruskal and others. Some of them are sequential algorithms while others can be parallel ones. So, please describe as many parallel algorithms as possible in pseudocode.(Example: Boruvka, Red/Blue Algo)

  2. Solve: P194.14

  3. A data structure supporting the operations of taking unions of sets and finding out to which set an element belongs can be implemented in a way where each set is represented by a tree. When the union of two sets are taken, the tree representing the smaller set will be attached to the larger one. Prove that for any tree representing a set in this data structure, its height will not exceed the base-2 logarithm of its cardinality.
  4.	Think about the aspects of the MST problem not covered in class, and consider if there’s more work to be done. For example, you may think about whether an algorithm which applies to cases with some constraints and runs faster than the established lower bound for the general case exists. You can also think about whether the problem can be solved faster with a certain probability. Do some research to find out about the latest status related to the problem.
